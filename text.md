hello everyone nice to meet you! 
my name is Hidenori Fujino.
I'm from Fukui prefectural University, Japan.
Do you know where Fukui is? Probably no one knows. Fukui is very local city in Japan. But recently becoming famous for dinosaur fossils. 
If you have a chance, please visit Fukui and enjoy a dinosaur.

Then Today I would like to talk about psychological safety and safety culture for safety resilience.

This is the outline of my presentation.
First, I’ll briefly explain what safety culture is.
Then, I’ll discuss how safety culture relates to the idea of safety resilience, which focuses on how systems maintain safety in dynamic and uncertain situations.
After that, I’ll introduce the concept of psychological safety, and why it matters in organizational behavior.
I’ll also present the expected relationship between psychological safety and safety culture — and how they might influence each other.
Then, I’ll give a brief overview of my empirical study, including what I’ve done so far.
And finally, I’ll share some thoughts on future directions for this research.
So let’s get started with the first topic — What’s safety culture?
[eop]

# What's Safety Culture?:
Safety Culture is a key concept in organizational safety management.
This concept originated from Chernobyl NPP accident, 1986, in Soviet Union.
After investigating the accident, safety culture was identified as one of its major contributing factors by IAEA. 
At that time, safety culture is defined as assembly of characteristics and attitudes in organizations and individuals which establishes that, as an overriding priority, nuclear plant safety issues receive the attention warranted by their significance.
Related to this definition, you may feel difficult to grasp aspect of organization. 
So I will explain briefly.

# A brief note on “Organizational aspect of Culture”:
Basically, organizational culture consists of both visible and invisible elements.

First, the visible aspects include things like:
– Tangible elements such as the workplace layout, equipment and tools, formal management systems, structures of organizaiton and so on.
– Cognitive elements like members’ behavior, languages, and terminology

On the other hand, there are invisible aspects.
These include shared norms, beliefs, and values among members,
as well as basic underlying assumptions — such as conceptual frameworks that shape their thinking unconsciously, or taken-for-granted “common sense” within the organization.

These assumptions exist throughout the organization, often without being explicitly recognized.

This figure is Schein’s three-level model of organizational culture.

It shows how the most visible level — artifacts — are shaped by the middle layer: espoused beliefs and values.
And those beliefs and values, in turn, are established by the deepest level: basic underlying assumptions.
At the same time, artifacts can also reinforce beliefs and values, which in turn help sustain the underlying assumptions, creating a dynamic relationship among the three levels.

In practice, when analyzing a culture, we often observe artifacts first, try to interpret the values behind them,
and then work to identify the deeper assumptions that truly shape the organization’s culture.

But if it were difficult for you to grasp the meanings immediately, you can understand it more simply as all members should operate with not forgetting to be afraid of the hazards in their system and keep their intelligent and respectful wariness to the hazards. 

When the Chernobyl accident happened, not only that nuclear power plant organization, but also all the nuclear power industry and the local and central government — in other words, all levels of the society of nuclear power of Soviet Union have quite weakened safety culture. 
That is, Most operators at the Chernobyl plant had never been trained on the importance of safety procedures and given procedures' quality itself was very poor.
Managers prioritized following the operational plan over ensuring safety.
Although scientists and technologists had voiced safety concerns to the central government in Moscow, these warnings were ignored.]
Moreover, the government in Moscow was only interested to maintain the plans they developed to run the society of Soviet Union.
Under such situation, when the accident happened, they blamed frontline workers and avoided taking responsibility themselves.

# Relationship of “Safety Culture” to “Safety Resilience”:
Next, I illustrate the relationship between "Safety Culture" and "Safety Resilience.“
On the left side, I show a common understanding of safety — that safety is static and stable. In this view, the system is expected to remain safe simply by following fixed rules or maintaining structure.
However, on the right side, we depict the actual nature of safety — that it is dynamic and maintained through continuous adjustments. From this view, Safety is often described as a “dynamic non-event,” meaning that safety is not simply the absence of incidents, but the result of continuous efforts by members to prevent accidents.
A system may appear stable, not because it's inherently safe, but because its members are resilient — they adapt to small disturbances, errors, or environmental changes.
But — and this is key — if attention to safety declines, the system can gradually drift into an unsafe state without immediate warning, potentially leading to an accident.
So, Safety Culture plays a crucial role in supporting this resilience — encouraging constant awareness, communication, and proactive actions to prevent harm.

# How to cultivate Safety Culture:
Now, let’s talk about how to cultivate safety culture in practice.
One of the most influential approaches comes from James Reason. 
James Reason has been one of the most influential safety scientists over the past 40 years and is well known for his Swiss Cheese Model. He also proposed the idea of an "Informed Culture" to cultivate safety culture in an organization.
This approach involves three key steps:
First, organizations need to gather daily data related to risks and hazards from the field.
Second, they must analyze the data and extract lessons from it.
And third, those lessons must be shared and applied across the entire organization — from frontline workers to top management, and from the personal level to the team and organizational levels.
This process helps ensure that everyone — at every level — is learning from experience and continuously improving safety.
In fact, this is the very purpose of developing and maintaining a Safety Information System in high-tech industries.
Without this kind of informed feedback loop, safety culture cannot grow effectively.

# Three cultures required for Informed culture:
To build an Informed Culture, James Reason proposed that three foundational cultures are required:

First is  Reporting Culture.
This is about sharing the value of honestly reporting any incidents — including one’s own errors — in order to promote learning. It also involves creating proper systems to collect and manage these reports, and making the act of reporting unsafe events a regular and encouraged practice.

Second is Just Culture.
In a just culture, all employees believe they will be treated fairly and justly — even when they report their own mistakes. This sense of fairness is essential to encourage reporting without fear.

And third, is Learning Culture.
This means that people are striving to become more competent and reliable, and that they are open and ready to change their practices when needed. In short, it’s about maintaining an attitude of continuous improvement.

These three cultures work together, like gears, to support an informed culture — where risks are visible, discussed, and used as learning opportunities, and ultimately helping to maintain members’ intelligent attention to hazards.

# What’s Psychological Safety:
From here, let’s move on to the concept of psychological safety.

Psychological safety was proposed by Professor Amy Edmondson in 1999 as one of the key concepts in organizational behavioral science.

It refers to a workplace atmosphere where all members can take interpersonal risks — like speaking up, asking questions, or even making mistakes — without the fear of negative consequences.

In other words, people feel free from fear and anxiety about being judged, blamed, or rejected.

This environment is essential for open communication, mutual trust, and continuous learning within teams.

So, while physical safety protects our bodies, psychological safety protects our ideas, voices, and engagement in the organization.

# Psychological Safety as Buzz word:
Recently, the term “psychological safety” has become something of a buzzword among Japanese managers and leaders across various sectors — from corporations to schools and universities.
The trigger for this growing attention was Google’s Project Aristotle, published in 2015.
In this project, Google analyzed more than 180 teams to identify the key factors that lead to strong team performance.
And what they discovered was striking: The most important factor wasn’t team composition, background, or skill — it was psychological safety.
In other words, the ability of team members to speak up, take risks, and be themselves without fear of negative consequences turned out to be the strongest predictor of a high-performing team.
Since then, psychological safety has gained attention not just as an academic concept, but as a practical strategy for better teamwork.

# Relationship between Psychological Safety and Safety Culture:
Now, let’s take a closer look at the psychological barriers that prevent people from reporting incidents — especially when those incidents involve their own mistakes.
First, there is the fear of being blamed or even abused by supervisors.
Second, people may feel ashamed in front of their colleagues, especially if they think they made a “stupid” error.
Others may hesitate because reporting the incident means reliving the pain of the mistake — mentally going through the experience again.
And finally, there’s the simple burden of having to write a report or attend an interview, which can feel time-consuming or stressful.
All of these factors create an environment where people hold back, even when they know reporting is the right thing to do.
But here’s the key point: If psychological safety exists in the organization, people are more likely to feel safe, supported, and respected — and as a result, they can be freed from these fears and encouraged to speak up.

# Questionnaire survey:
So from here, I’ll briefly introduce my own study. 
The goal was to test if the relationship between psychological safety and safety communication climate can actually be seen in real-world data.
Here are the details about the participants and the survey period.
[eop]

# Indices:
Psychological Safety was measured using Edmondson’s original 7 items, translated into Japanese by Maruyama and Fuji (2022).
Safety Communication Climate was measured using 4 original items that I developed for this study.
The other indices — Safety-Oriented Motivation, Safety Performance, and Experience of Near-Miss — were based on the scales developed by Ikeda et al.
All items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale, where 1 meant “disagree” and 5 meant “agree.”
[eop]

# Result (1) : Analysis of correlations: 
Here is the result of the correlation analysis.
As you can see, the correlation between psychological safety and safety communication climate is almost zero.
That is, there was no meaningful relationship found between the two.
[eop]

# Result (2) : Analysis of structure equation modeling:
To explore the psychological structure of the relationships in more detail, I also conducted a structural equation modeling analysis. 
while there is no significant relationship between safety communication climate and psychological safety as I Mentioned now, both of them lead to safety-oriented motivation and result in safety performance.
[eop]

# Why could not the relationship be observed?:
So, why couldn’t we observe the expected relationship between psychological safety and safety communication climate?
One possible reason is that participants may have regarded safety communication simply as part of their job.
In other words, regardless of how psychologically safe they felt, those with a strong commitment to safety would naturally engage in safety communication — while others with lower commitment wouldn’t, even if they felt safe.


So, feeling psychologically safe doesn’t automatically lead to active communication. 
It may be necessary, but not sufficient on its own.
Another possibility is a methodological issue. Both  psychological safety and safety communication climate showed lower Cronbach’s alpha values than the acceptable level.
So the validity of the scales used should be reviewed in future studies.
[eop]

# Future work:
To conclude, I’d like to share some directions for future work — both theoretical and practical.
On the theoretical side, I plan to continue examining the relationship between psychological safety and reporting culture.
One promising  area is the moderating effect of individual safety commitment — that is, how much each member values safety may influence how psychological safety translates into reporting behavior.
I also aim to explore other factors that could be related to reporting culture or similar safety-related constructs.
On the practical side, I’m interested in developing leadership training programs for managers to foster a stronger safety culture.
Personally, I believe that servant leadership holds promise as an effective approach in this context.
Another possibility is applying AI technologies to safety information systems.If AI can gather safety-related information while maintaining privacy, interpersonal risks could be reduced and information exchange would become more active and smooth.
Through these approaches, I hope we can create safer, more open, and more supportive workplaces.
